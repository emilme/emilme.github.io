	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>I like to think about the Internet. Currently at <a href="http://www.newamerica.org/oti/">New America's Open Technology Institute</a>, soon to be Stanford Law.  
	Before joining New America, I was a Fulbright Scholar in South Korea, researching the sharing economy and the Korean efforts to seed a startup ecosystem. I graduated from Yale.</p>
