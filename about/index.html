	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>Policy program associate at <a href="http://www.newamerica.org/oti/">New America's Open Technology Institute</a>. I like to think about the Internet.</p>
	<p>Before joining New America, I was a Fulbright Scholar in South Korea, researching the sharing economy and the Korean efforts to seed a startup ecosystem in Seoul. I'm an alumna of Yale and <a href="https://www.harpethhall.org">the Harpeth Hall School</a>, and hail from Nashville, TN.</p>
	<p>I've previously worked with the Berkman Center for Internet and Society's <a href="https://chillingeffects.org/">Chilling Effects</a> project, and helped build <a href="http://open.innovatesf.com/openlaw/">SF Open Law</a> for the Mayor's Office of Civic Innovation in San Francisco.</p>
