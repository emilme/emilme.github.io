	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>I like to think about the Internet, law, cities, and the environment. Currently based in Washington, D.C. as a policy program associate at <a href="http://www.newamerica.org/oti/">New America's Open Technology Institute</a>. 
	Before joining New America, I was a Fulbright Scholar in South Korea, researching the sharing economy and the Korean efforts to seed a startup ecosystem in Seoul. I'm an alumna of Yale and the <a href="https://www.harpethhall.org">Harpeth Hall School</a>, and hail from Nashville, TN.</p>
