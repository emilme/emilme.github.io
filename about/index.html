	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>Policy program associate at <a href="www.newamerica.org/oti/">New America's Open Technology Institute</a>.</p>
	<p>I like to think about the Internet, cities, and food.</p>
	<p>Before joining New America, I was a Fulbright Scholar in South Korea, 
	  doing fieldwork on the social and economic impacts (of what is sometimes called) the sharing economy in Seoul, and covering the Korean efforts to seed a startup ecosystem. I graduated from Yale University with a BA in Environmental Studies, and wrote my undergraduate thesis on how race and the built environment contribute to the digital divide. 
	  I previously worked with the Berkman Center for Internet and Society's <a href="https://chillingeffects.org/">Chilling Effects</a> project, and helped build <a href="open.innovatesf.com/openlaw/">SF Open Law</a> for the Mayor's Office of Civic Innovation in San Francisco. </p>
