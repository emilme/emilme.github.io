	<h1>About</h1>
	<p>I like to think about the internet. Currently a CA-based law student. Before law school, I worked in public interest tech policy at <a href="http://www.newamerica.org/oti/">New America's Open Technology Institute</a>.  
	Before joining New America, I was a Fulbright Scholar in South Korea, researching the sharing economy and efforts to seed a startup ecosystem in Seoul.</p>
